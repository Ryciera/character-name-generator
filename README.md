# character-name-generator
A generator to pick out a random first and last name from a number of databases.

See it live here: http://www.mossystones.net/gen/people/characternames.php

This program does the following:
- Picks values, such as names, at random from a database and populates them on a page.
- Allows user to continue generating names (making their list longer and longer), or clear the list entirely and start from scratch.
- Some generators allow user to pick different stipulations (such as, only generating Spanish female names).
- Provides links for extended research.

# NOTE:

This sample code is not functional unless you add connections to your own database. I've omitted all connections to my database for security purposes.

This sample code will also look like crap without the templates from my website. It is not provided here to run, but simply see how it's programmed live on my page.
